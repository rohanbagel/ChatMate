# Django WebSocket Group & Public Chat

This project is a Django-based web application showcasing basic WebSocket functionality to enable real-time communication in the form of group chat and public chat. The application utilizes Daphne as the ASGI server and integrates HTMX for creating dynamic, interactive chat features without requiring full-page reloads.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Leverages WebSocket connections to facilitate instant communication between users.
- **Public Chat:** An open chatroom accessible to all users.
- **Dynamic Frontend:** Uses HTMX to update the chat interface dynamically, enhancing user experience by minimizing page reloads.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built using Django Channels and Daphne for asynchronous server-side communication.
